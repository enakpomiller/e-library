Timothy Reddick - Free Indeed lyrics

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
No chains are holding me
It's who I choose to be
Everybody say now

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
No chains are holding me
It's who I choose to be
It's who I choose to be
It's who I choose to be

I choose to be Free

I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
No chains are holding me
It's who I choose to be

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed

Listen, I changed the words
Was blind but now I see
It's who I'm meant to be

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
Was blind but now I see
It's who I'm meant to be
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/timothy-reddick/-/free-indeed.html]
It's who I'm meant to be

I choose to be Free

I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free
I choose to be Free

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
No chains are holding me
It's who I choose to be

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
Was blind but now I see
It's who I'm meant to be

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
No chains are holding me
It's who I choose to be

I'm free indeed
In Christ I'm free indeed
Was blind but now I see
It's who I'm meant to be
